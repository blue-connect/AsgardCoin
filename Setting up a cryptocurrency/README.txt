Forking a cryptocurrency 


Hello, this folder has all the command lines used in the forking of the cryptocurrency turtle coin. If you open the outline doc you will be shown a general layout for the steps, this will help with keeping track of where you are in the process.
The server setup and the local setup docs can be used in any order. 
The finalizing commands are basically just the finishing commands you will need to create the wallet, start mining and open a wallet that properly checks all the transactions of your block chain. 

My local computer is a 2017 apple MacBook Pro running iOS 11.4 big Sur 
The servers are running ubuntu 16.04 with 2gb of ram
